# Music-Band-Guess-
A program with information of band and band members is created by using UNIX command/Scripting language.

ABOUT THE PROGRAM
1. A user starts the program by typing the program name and first his/her first name 
and then the ID number as two parameters of the program.

2. The program shall ask for the secret key to run the program; a user should 
program this secret key in advance. If the user enters the correct secret key it should 
move to the next step (3), else it should prompt to enter the correct key three times and 
then exit the program.

3. The program welcomes the user somehow mentioning his/her ID number first, 
then his/her name, and then displays the date and the time of the execution.

4. The program displays five codes and names of the five countries team that has 
played Football (one code and name per line) and asks the user to guess which the one 
is best music band. The codes for Beatles, AC/DC, Queen, Blondie, and Nirvana are BEA, 
AD, QUE, BLO, and NIR respectively.

5. After the user typed the music band code, if the option is correct, the program 
informs about it and gives one-two sentence explaining some of the descriptions/ 
characteristics of the chosen band otherwise, the program warns about a mistake, and 
the user will guess until the correct option is chosen.

6. The program displays Five members of the band. The codes for five-star band 
members are John Lennon, Angus Young, Freddie Mercury, Debbie Harry, and Kurt 
Cobain are JL, AY, FM, DH, KC respectively.

7. Then the program invites to type three codes out of these five (the codes may be 
typed in any sequence).

8. The user types of these codes separate them by spaces.

10. The program displays a menu with these three codes and asks to choose one of 
them.

11. The user types the number of a chosen code in the list; the user will be able to type 
numbers until it is one of these three codes.

12. The program displays the code with a comment on the same line and then, starting 
from the next line, displays a 3-4 lines description of that player. The description is taken 
from a file, which is stored in a directory. If the file with that name is absent or not readable, 
the program informs the user about that and returns him/her to Step 4.

Users need to make three files out of five displayed in step 4, it shall be prepared by the 
developer in advance and saved in the same directory as the script.

12. The program asks whether the eight previous steps described above, (4) to (11), 
should be repeated.

13. If the user says ‘yes’, they are repeated; if the user says ‘no’, the program 
terminates.
